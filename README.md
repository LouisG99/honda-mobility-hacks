We have created a multi-part program. This consisting of getting and parsing through connected data and automonus data. This is done in Python and in R. Then we run our algorithm on the data that determines based on the driving habits and variables recorded on the drives, the safety hazard of any particualr driver.

This is useful to bikers, runners, and other drivers so they can see which directions have more dangerous drivers and choose to avoid those routes. 

There are different levels which an end-uder can select varying levels depending on if they are pros or kids and which level of drivers they wants to avoid.

This includes real-time updating of info to keep you and your loved ones safe.
