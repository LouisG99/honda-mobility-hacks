Honda Mobility Hackathon Submission
by Louis Gouirand, Adam Schreck, and Utsav Lathia


Our team took part in the first edition of Honda Mobility Hacks and we were awarded the second place in the competition for our project. This 24-hour hackathon was focused on mobility issues during which we built a program able to detect and classify dangerous drivers near you.
